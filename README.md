# RC Bluetooth Robot

This project involves the design and development of a robot that combines classic Bluetooth remote control with autonomous navigation support and a pick-and-place robotic arm. The key features include:

1. **Bluetooth Control Interface:**
The robot is primarily operated via a mobile device or Bluetooth-enabled controller using classic Bluetooth communication (HC-05/06 module), enabling remote movement in forward, reverse, left, and right directions.

2. **Obstacle Detection with Ultrasonic Sensor:**
An ultrasonic sensor is mounted on the chassis to detect obstacles in the robotâ€™s path. Sensor data is processed in real-time to support semi-autonomous decisions such as halting or rerouting when an object is too close, enhancing navigation safety.

3. **Pick-and-Place Mechanism:**
The robot is equipped with a servo-actuated robotic arm, capable of basic pick and place operations. The arm can be controlled through the same Bluetooth interface, allowing the user to grasp, lift, and drop small objects with precision.

> The project signifies key skills in embedded systems, motor control, Bluetooth communication and sensor integration, offering a hands-on introduction to mobile robotics and semi-autonomous systems.
